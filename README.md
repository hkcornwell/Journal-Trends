# Automated analysis of leading academic journals

### Introduction
Every year, thousands of scientific papers are peer reviewed and published in verified academic journals focused on a wide range of different industries. For a single journal, the compilation of small findings in accepted manuscripts come together to help make significant breakthroughs in cutting-edge industries. For an individual highly experienced in a specific field, sifting through these papers to summarize a recently released volume maynot be very time consuming. For outsiders, however, this is much more challenging to accomplish.

The below notebook demonstrates how a user can automate the process of analyzing an entire journal ofacademic papers. **utils.py** contains multiple functions that can scrape journals from the web and perform different analyses on what an industry is focusing on and where the industry is trending towards in the future. Currently, the journals of interest are limited to the availability in *ScienceDirect* but can easily be extended toother websites that house academic journals.

### How to use
**Journal_Trend_Analysis_Walkthrough.ipynb** contains a walkthrough of how to use the various functions packaged in **utils.py**. To perform another analysis on a different journal, **Journal_Trend_Analysis_Template.ipynb** does not contain the explaination and can be copied.
